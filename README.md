# OSINT-Basics
This is a barebones script to install a few tools for OSINT tasks I find very helpful. 
   - It will update and dist-upgrade before install. Fair warning...
   - You will be required to have your git keys squared away or it will fail
   - You will want to add the appropriate API keys after full install.

# This only pulls the repo's needed. It does not install. That is deliberate.
